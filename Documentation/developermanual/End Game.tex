		While no token on the board, the player holds four action tokens. There is a created testing file in the folder "During the game". After creating a new game, select the Load menu button and choose "No available token".  & The expectation is that the current player can still click or drag the token on hand in attempting. However, a warning alert pops out that No available token for the player, and please start a new game.  The result is shown as expected because the current player cannot do anything and the game should be restarted.   \\
