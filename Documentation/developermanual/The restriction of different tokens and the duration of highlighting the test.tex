		\midrule
		While the chess board does not contain any token, and the human player tries to use the Remove token function. & The expectation of this test case is that the human player could not select Remove token on hand. And the result of this testing shows precisely what we have expected. The human player cannot click the Remove token when there is nothing to remove from the board.  \\ 
		\midrule
		A Remove token is being triggered and observe the changes on the player's hand. & The expectation is that the player's hand will not get a new token and simply just get the token, which is removed from the board. And the final result shows the expectation perfectly.  \\
		\midrule
		Test duration of remove token. The removed token should be marked and the marking sign should only exist for a short time. After beginning a game, click on the options menu to decide the duration time of highlighting. & The expectation is only the highlighted region of the removed token on board should fade out. And the marked region of the removed sign should not change and stay as normal. And the result shows as expected. \\
