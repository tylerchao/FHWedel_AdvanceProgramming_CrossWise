\section{Development configuration}

This project is mainly based on the JAVA programming language and the IDEs of this project are using IntelliJ IDEA. To develop a desktop application,  the java library JavaFX is utilized for building a GUI platform. Moreover, to port FXML mark-up to an IDE, Scene Builder is chosen for this project to facilitate. All the specified compiled versions of the software components are shown in Table~\ref{tab:software version} below.
