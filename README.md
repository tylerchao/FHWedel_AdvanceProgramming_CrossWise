# CrossWise


# Project Description
CrossWise is a straightforward 6x6 board game designed for a maximum of four players, divided into two teams: the Vertical Team and the Horizontal Team. The game always splits these two teams against each other. The Vertical Team exclusively focuses on the vertical lines of the game board, while the Horizontal Team concentrates on the horizontal lines.

At the start of the game, each player possesses four tokens in their hand. In every round, players have the opportunity to strategically place a token on the chess board or utilize a functional token to advance their objectives.

Additionally, there are subsequent sections that provide comprehensive details regarding the game rules, the elements involved, and the conditions necessary for achieving victory.

See the documentation of `crosswise.pdf` for details.
